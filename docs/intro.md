## Community-Governance
This repo is setup to gather and focuss discusions regarding the proposed installement of a community governance over the funds that are currently in the community treasury of the IOTA Chrysalis Main - Network.

It is created as an open place to exchange thoughts, form working groups, explore topics and create different approaches about this complicated topic. Every discussion and action here will be transparent and open source and free for everyone to contribute.

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing

Main go-to point for everyone that wants to contribute will be the "Discussions" Tab 

https://github.com/iota-community/Community-Governance/discussions 

where we did put up some topics to keep the talk a bit more specific in a forum style. So opinions can be better formulated and will stay visible and easily found.
If you have a topic to discuss please check it it fits under one of the main topics (voting power, voting proposals, ...) and add it as a comment there to avoid the forum spreading out over to many threads.

This should not be a place of disputes over the past or the actions that lead to the fork, but of constructive forward thinking working. Critical questioning of everything that happens here is welcome and encouraged, but spam or toxic behaviour will not bring us forward and so should not be a part of this repo here.


Basic and starting point of this proccess is the anouncement made by the IOTA Foundation in this blog-post 

https://blog.iota.org/iota-community-treasury-and-genesis-validation/ 

and the clarification blog-post 

https://blog.iota.org/unclaimed-tokens-community-treasury-and-iota-as-faq/

Goal will be to propose a voting mechanism and votable options to the community what should happen to this Tokens.
It might also be used to develop ideas and processes how a possible community governed use of those funds can be established, if the community comes to a vote and decides to establish such a system.

The nature of Github Repos allows us to have a verifiable track of all changes and to make it possible for everyone to contribute to the project by issuing commits and pull request.
