# Community-Governance
This repo is setup to gather and focuss discusions regarding the proposed installement of a community governance over the funds that are currently in the community treasury address.
It is created as an open place to exchange thoughts, form working groups, explore topics and create different approaches about this complicated topic. Every discussion and action here will be transparent and open source and free for everyone to contribute.
This should not be a place of disputes, but of constructive forwrd thinking working. Critical questioning of everything that happens here is welcome and encouraged, but spam or toxic behaviour will not bring us forward and so should not be a part of this repo here.
