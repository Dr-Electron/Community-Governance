# Community-Governance
This repo is setup to gather and focuss discusions regarding the proposed installement of a community governance over the funds that are currently in the community treasury of the IOTA Chysalis Main - Network.

It is created as an open place to exchange thoughts, form working groups, explore topics and create different approaches about this complicated topic. Every discussion and action here will be transparent and open source and free for everyone to contribute.

This should not be a place of disputes over the past or the actions that lead to the fork, but of constructive forward thinking working. Critical questioning of everything that happens here is welcome and encouraged, but spam or toxic behaviour will not bring us forward and so should not be a part of this repo here.

Basic and starting point of this proccess is the anouncement made by the IOTA Foundation in this blog - post 
https://blog.iota.org/iota-community-treasury-and-genesis-validation/

Goal will be to propose a voting mechanism and votable options to the community what should happen to this Tokens.
It might also be used to develop ideas and processes how a possible community governed use of those funds can be established, if the community comes to a vote and decides to establish such a system.
